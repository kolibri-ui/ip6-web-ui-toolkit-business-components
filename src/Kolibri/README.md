# Kolibri

If you want to use Kolibri, please have a look at the  

[Home Page](https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/Kolibri/index.html)

where you find how to "install" and use the Kolibri and how
you become owner of the code without the need for any license.



## Notes for developers

The src dir is under docs such that we can publish the sources directly.

When changing default css or the style API, make sure to check examples, test report, and
[style overview](https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/Kolibri/src/examples/style/styleOverview.html).
