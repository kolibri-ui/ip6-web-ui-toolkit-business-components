### Run Application on localhost
To run the application on the localhost there are two possibilities:
* Open the Project in your IDE and start the index.html from the root folder
* Open your command line, change to the root directory of the Project and run ```npx http-server -c-1``` (needs npm installed). Then follow the instructions printed by the http-server on commandline. Usually open http://1270.0.1:8080 in your Browser.

:exclamation: It is not possible to directly open the index.html File in a Browser, because of CORS Restrictions applied to the JavaScript Modules.


### Deployed Application on Netlify
The Masterbranch of the Project will be builded and deployed to Netlify on every push or merge.

> The Netlify Application is suspended. You can Setup it easy by yourself.
> Create an account on netlify.com and follow the steps to deploy an application. 
> When deployed, the links are working for /demo/switch-demo.html, /demo/monolog-demo.html, /demo/workinghours/workinghours, /demo/usability-test/usability-test.html, /test/alltests
